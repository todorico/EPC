V1.0.6
------
 - Subpixel offset was not rotated w.r.t. dominant direction---fixed (thanks to Geert Willems)
 - Surf is now a shared library, surflib.h provides an interface to the library
 - Option to load interest points, verbose output flag (thanks to Bastian Leibe)
Internal:
 - Makefile updated to actually react to changes in source code
 - Changed data structure for interest points to vector<>, removed unnecessary indirections
 - Removed unnecessary allocation/deallocation in many places
 - Slight speed up (about 10%)
